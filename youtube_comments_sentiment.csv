""Coding"" का मतलब होता है किसी प्रोग्राम या सॉफ्टवेयर के लिए इंस्ट्रक्शन्स या कोड को लिखना। Coding करने से हम विभिन्न तरीकों से कंप्यूटर या अन्य इलेक्ट्रॉनिक डिवाइस्स को इंस्ट्रक्ट कर सकते हैं ताकि वे विशेष कार्यों को सम्पादित कर सकें और विभिन्न उपयोगकर्ता के आवश्यकताओं को पूरा कर सकें।

Coding करने के फायदे:

तकनीकी नई सृजनशीलता: Coding से नए और नवीनतम तकनीकों और समस्या समाधानों के लिए सॉफ्टवेयर और ऐप्स विकसित करने में मदद मिलती है।
करियर अवसर: आजकल कई कंपनियां तकनीकी कौशल के साथ विशेषज्ञों की तलाश में होती हैं, इसलिए Coding से योग्यता होने पर आपको करियर में अधिक अवसर मिलते हैं।
समस्या समाधान: Coding से हम विभिन्न समस्याओं का समाधान करने में सक्षम होते हैं, जैसे कंप्यूटर प्रोग्रामिंग के माध्यम से उचित सॉफ्टवेयर या एप्लिकेशन विकसित करके।
रोजगार के मौके: तकनीकी क्षेत्र में सरकार और निजी कंपनियों में Coding के लिए रोजगार के मौके बढ़ रहे हैं।
रचनात्मकता: Coding करने से आपको क्रिएटिविटी का एक नया रूप दिखाई देता है, जहां आप नए और अद्भुत सॉफ्टवेयर बनाने में लगे रहते हैं।
यह सामान्य फायदे हैं, लेकिन इसके अलावा भी बहुत से अन्य लाभ हो सकते हैं जो व्यक्ति के उपयोग के साथ बढ़ते हैं।

Can you please make a video for how to solve any code problem. When i go to solve any problem i place so many problem like how to write which code write what is the logic. How i think this code is for this problem. This is the main reason I'm moving from programing.Because of this I feel like I can't reach my goal. I'm very worried about it.It would be nice if you could explain it with an example. I think he told me to solve this program Solve Quadratic Equation. I know that I have to use some basic lines but I don't know how to understand the rest of what to use and which line to write. Due to this problem I am not able to participate in any competition anywhere. Studying computer science seems to be the wrong thing to do. Looks like I can't do anything by programming. Please give me some suggestions.,Positive
